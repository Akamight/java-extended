# java-extended
hey guys!
i am a newcomer to the github family XD!
i am not a coder, but actually learning java and c++;
this project is basically improving development speed of my personal future projects XD;
it will actually lower the performances, so don't use it for anything really big XD;
it will suck but i will keep developing it for probably years.
